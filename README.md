# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data
Kickstarter Challenge with Excel

## Overview and Purpose of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to help Louise obtain a better understanding of her campaigns success in relation to other campaigns held. The Kickstarter data provided was used to complete the analysis. The main focus was to compare the different launch goals, dates, and the categories of the campaigns, to understand  the impact it had on the outcome of the campaign.The analysis was completed through Excel and  allowed one to create a better and understable visualization for Louise by breaking down and merging differing data.
 

## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis was able to be completed through excel formulas and functions that allowed the data to be better understood. In example, the kickstarter information provided was used to create graphs, tables, and visuals that could be better understood by the reader, in this case Louise. Some of the challenges faced while creating the analysis was finding shortcuts when using long formulas. Another challege was to watch for minor mistakes that could completely alter the data and therefore the graphs and tables as well. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Theater outcomes based on launch dates analysis was completed through gathering all the data from the kickstarter sheet and then creating a pivot table to filter out the information. The information was filtered by category, years, launch date, and outcomes. The then filtered information was used to create a line graph with markers in order to better understand in a visual form the campaign outcome based launch date throughout time. There was not many challenges I faced when creating this analysis but I could see how imporer filtering or incorrect time conversion could impact your results.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The analysis done Based on Goals was more time consuming and required a better understand of using excel functions. Using the financial goal ranges and the COUNTIF formula consisted of having better knowledge of excel functions. The COUNTIF formula was a challenge I faced when it came to not making minor mistakes and working with different ranges. The SUM and Percentage formula was easier and was what helped better vicualize the graph.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Overall, there was not many challenges rather than understanding the functions and paying close attention to details when performing the analysis. 

## Results
-The results for the Outcomes based on Launch Date
The best months to launch a theater campaign are during the months of April through August, peak is May and June, although there is a higher amount of campaigns released the success rate is higher rather than in later months of the year. Failed campaigns were remotely consistent but increased during the summer months but were low relative to the amount released. 
- The Outcomes Based on Goals for play campaigns were an inverse relation. Their was a higher success percentage for having a low financial goal. Meanwhile a higher failure percentage if the financial goal was higher, in example there was a 100% chance of failure for those who had a goal between 45000 and 49999.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some limitations from this data set is that I think it is still vague if someone were to try to use this information to really start a campaign. I think there needs to be more tables created in order to see a better trend of campaign success.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
One could create other tables and graphs in relation to different categories other than theater and plays. Also, create an anlysis based on deadline for campaigns.
